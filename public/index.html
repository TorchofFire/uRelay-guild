    <h1>This is a page</h1>
    <p>
      My thoughts are this could be used either by owner, or it could be
      auto-generated to show guild name, stats, etc.
    </p>
    <p>or maybe instructions for downloading a client</p>
    <p>from the perspective of: someone gives you a domain and no other info</p>
    <p>could use guild-info route to populate</p>
